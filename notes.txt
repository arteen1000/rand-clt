NOTES FOR ASSIGNMENT 5
----------------------

    * re-organized randall.c into headers and .c files
    * made sure that all dependencies correct
    * fixed Makefile to accomodate
    * implemented 'make check' to check output length
    commited to git

    * began writing in notes.txt
    * read entire program to understand every line
    * separated initial parsing into options.h & options.c
    * changed 'make check' so exit status reflects whether
    check succeeded

    * made assumption that since base option for `-i` is
    rdrand, should fail when no option given and rdrand
    not available
