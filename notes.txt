NOTES FOR ASSIGNMENT 5
----------------------

    * re-organized randall.c into headers and .c files
    * made sure that all dependencies correct
    * fixed Makefile to accomodate
    * implemented 'make check' to check output length
    commited to git

    * began writing in notes.txt
    * read entire program to understand every line
    * separated initial parsing into options.h & options.c
    * changed 'make check' so exit status reflects whether
    check succeeded

    * made assumption that since base option for `-i` is
    rdrand, should fail when no option given and rdrand
    not available

    * implemented options parsing by going through argv[]
    step by step and checking for all possible inputs
    manually
    * refactored code in randall.c to fit within implementation
    * checked all possible test cases (option combinations)
    and ensured correctness
    * performed 'make check' to ensure correctness of program
    itself

    * extended options parsing and made more accurate for use
    with the differing -i options
    * began implementing the -i options and separating logic,
    added additional declarations and definitions
    * found mrand48_r not defined on local machine, tarballing
    and moving to lnxsrv11
